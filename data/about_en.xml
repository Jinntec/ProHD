            <p>
               <hi rendition="#b">Proyecto Humboldt Digital (ProHD)</hi> is an international
               initiative for continuing education in the digital humanities, which takes place in
               two locations: Havana (Casa Museo Alejandro de Humboldt) and Berlin
               (Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities).</p>
            <p>It focuses on the study of the Cuban scientific and literary culture of the 18th and
               19th centuries, especially on making relevant Cuban sources available online to study
               the period when Alexander von Humboldt visited and worked on Cuban society, economy
               and culture (1800-1830).</p>
            <p>The project started in 2019 and is scheduled for completion in 2023. It has been
               funded thanks to generous support from the Auswärtiges Amt, Fritz Thyssen Stiftung and
               Gerda Henkel Stiftung.</p>

            <head>Editing principles</head>
            <p>The textual sources of the editions published in the "Digital Dossier: Alexander von
               Humboldt and Cuba (1800-1830)" stem from libraries and archives in Germany,
               Cuba and Poland; for more information on the provenance, please consult the metadata
               section of each edition. The "Digital Dossier" contains textual documents in
               manuscript and printed format, in four languages (English, French, German and
               Spanish), thematically related to Humboldt's trip to Cuba and the questions that the
               Prussian scientist studied in the <title>Essai politique sur
                  l'île de Cuba</title>.</p>
            <p>The text of each edition is offered in double presentation: on the one hand, in the diplomatic transcription an attempt has been made to retain the spelling peculiarities of the source, including the graphic and phonetic aspects of American Spanish, abbreviations and spaces between words; on the other hand, in the normalized text, the abbreviations have been resolved and spaces and punctuation marks have been introduced in order to improve the readability of the text. In both versions, accents have been added according to the current norm to make the text easier to read and to maintain conformity with the editorial traditions established in the BBAW for Humboldt's texts.</p>

            <head>Technical Aspects</head>
            <p>The texts of the digital editions of the "Digital Dossier" have been encoded in XML format following the <ref target="https://tei-c.org/">Text Encoding Initiative</ref> (P. 5) Guidelines. To
               facilitate the encoding task, the framework ediarum developed by TELOTA has been
               adapted resulting in <ref target="https://github.com/humboldtdigital/ediarum.PROHD.edit">ediarum.PROHD.edit</ref>.</p>
            <p>The TEI markup has been carried out in order to identify the source from which the
               text is derived, those responsible for the edition and, whenever possible, the
               authorship and other data related to the creation process. As for the
               text, the following phenomena have been encoded: the pagination of the original
               source, headings and paragraphs, divisions and logical divisions of letters, changes
               in typography, authorial interventions such as strikethroughs or additions, uncertain
               readings, gaps, supplied words, etc. For more details on our TEI markup, it is
               recommended to consult the ediarum documentation available in <ref target="https://www.ediarum.org/docs/ediarum.BASE.manual/">German</ref> and <ref target="https://www.ediarum.org/docs/ediarum.BASE.manual_es/">Spanish</ref>.</p>
            <p>This web application has been built with <ref target="https://teipublisher.com/index.html">TEI Publisher</ref> (v. 7.0.0.) and
                  <ref target="http://exist-db.org/exist/apps/homepage/index.html">eXistDB</ref> (v.
               5.2.0.). An ODD called prohd.xml is used to style the editions and static pages and
               two templates called prohd.html and view-grid-prohd.html are used to build the
               graphical user interface with web components. A copy of the files that make up the
               web application is available at the <ref target="https://github.com/humboldtdigital/ProHD">project's Github
                  repository</ref>. Both the web application and the facsimiles are hosted on servers of the
               Oficina del Historiador de la Ciudad de La Habana; the facsimiles use <ref target="https://iiif.io/">IIIF</ref>'s API.</p>
            <p>The development of the framework ediarum.PROHD.edit and of this web application has
               been carried out by Antonio Rojas Castro with the collaboration of Violeta López.
